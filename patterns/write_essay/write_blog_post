## Keyword Match Types for SEO and AdWords

keyword research boils down to identifying keywords your prospective customer uses, and additional keywords you can use in your content to boost traffic, and more importantly, conversions. In a nutshell, this means the relevancy of the keywords you choose has a bearing on your SEO and AdWords performance.

There are three keyword match types

1. Broad Match Type: The default keyword match type, broad match offers you the opportunity to reach the largest audience possible. However, the traffic you generate isn’t refined and takes a lot of effort to convert.
Why? Because broad match type keywords make the bulk of online searches. Nearly everybody on the internet uses a broad match type keyword at one time or another to find information. For instance, if you choose a broad match for the key phrase “WordPress themes,” users might see your ad when they search for “premium WordPress themes,” “themes for WordPress,” “WordPress templates,” “WordPress themes,” “website themes” and “free themes” among others.
2. Phrase Match Type: restricts search queries to your key phrase exactly as it appears even if there are other terms before or after it. For instance, if you choose phrase match type in AdWords for the phrase “WordPress themes,” Google can show your ad for search queries like “WordPress themes,” “premium WordPress themes,” “responsive WordPress themes,” and “free WordPress themes 2018.”. the phrase will, however, not show in search queries such as “premium WP themes,” “WordPress responsive theme,” and any other related query that doesn’t match “WordPress themes” exactly as it appears. Phrase match is more targeted than the default broad match but more flexible than exact match.
3. Exact Match Type: The most restrictive of all match types, exact match type offers you the most control over who sees your ad. Here, you are targeting the people most interested in what you offer. In other words, exact match allows you to show your adverts only when the searcher uses the exact word or phrase you’re bidding on in AdWords. Yes, you attract lesser traffic, but the click-through rate (CTR) is impressive. Google recommends using a combination of match types. For instance, you can choose broad and exact match type, so you can reach a wide audience while restricting who sees your ads.

## user intent

The user’s intent is the searcher’s goal – the goal you are looking to meet with your content and products. understanding the intent behind the keywords the searcher uses and the order in which they use them is an integral part of a good SEO keyword strategy. there are 4 categories of keyword intent namely:

- Navigational intent:There are search queries that show you the searcher was simply trying to find your website. For instance, if a searcher enters “mythemeshop website” in Google, they are most likely looking for mythemeshop.com. You’ve probably entered “Facebook,” “Gmail,” or “BuzzFeed” into Google search in a bid to reach the respective sites.
- Investigational intent: investigational intent searches are “not directly transactional, and may never result in an exchange of goods, services or monies, but they’re not purely informational either.”. web visitors who trigger investigational intent search queries are looking for a little more specific information than a user who is just perusing.
- Informational intent: A majority of searchers are merely browsing around looking for information about this and that. If you have a pressing issue, you probably head over to Google to look for information before settling down on a specific product to alleviate your pain. As such, odds are high that a majority of your own searches in Google are largely informational. Most times, you’re simply after information about a problem you have.
- Transactional intent:A searcher using keyword combinations that include product names and but terms such as “deal,” “buy,” “best price,” “coupon,” and “shipping” among others is seriously considering to buy. With this in mind, it goes without saying that building product and landing pages around transactional keywords results in more sales.

## keyword types

The rule of thumb here is to use medium tail keywords that are 3 words long, of course, in combination with a short tail and long tail keywords. Always use relevant keywords that appear naturally in your content. Remember, you’re creating content for real people, not just search engine crawlers.

The keyword type fall into 3 categories bellow.

- Short Tail Keywords: short tail keywords are broad keyword phrases that have one or two words. They are too general.
- Medium Tail Keywords: Medium tail keywords are search queries that fall between short tail and long tail keywords. Medium tail keywords are a bit more specific than short tail keywords. While short tail keywords are one to two words long, medium tail keywords can have up to 4 words, but not a word more.
- Long Tail Keywords: Long tail keywords are the longest of the three types of SEO keywords, averaging 5 words and beyond. They are also the easiest to rank well on Google. Usually, long tail keywords don’t result in high volumes of traffic, but the traffic you get is highly specific and usually converts better than the traffic you gain from short and medium tail keywords.

- Keyword research's focus on identifying customer-used keywords for increased traffic and conversions.
- Relevance of chosen keywords is crucial for SEO and AdWords performance.

1. Recognize the significance of keyword match types in AdWords for optimizing traffic quality and volume.
2. Evaluate and choose the most suitable match type (broad, modified broad, phrase, or exact) based on your specific situation.
