EXAMPLE PAUL GRAHAM ESSAY, A SIMPLIFIED VERSION

Writing about something, even something you know well, usually shows you that you didn't know it as well as you thought. Putting ideas into words is like a tough test. The first words you pick are usually wrong; you have to rewrite sentences over and over to get them just right. And your ideas won't just be kind of unclear, but also not complete. Half the ideas that end up in an essay will be ones you thought of while you were writing it. That's why I write them.

Once you share something, the usual idea is that whatever you wrote was what you thought before you wrote it. These were your ideas, and now you've said them. But you know this isn't true. You know that putting your ideas into words changed them. And not just the ideas you shared. Maybe there were others that turned out to be too broken to fix, and those you threw away.

It's not just having to put your ideas into specific words that makes writing so hard. The real test is reading what you've written. You have to pretend to be a neutral reader who knows nothing of what's in your head, only what you wrote. When he reads what you wrote, does it seem right? Does it seem complete? If you make an effort, you can read your writing as if you were a complete stranger, and when you do, the news is usually not so good. It takes me many tries before I can get an essay past the stranger. But the stranger is rational, so you always can, if you ask him what he needs. If he's not happy because you didn't mention x or didn't explain some sentence enough, then you mention x or add more explanations. Happy now? It may cost you some nice sentences, but you have to agree to that. You just have to make them as good as you can and still satisfy the stranger.

This much, I assume, won't be that controversial. I think it will fit with the experience of anyone who has tried to write about anything not easy. There may be people whose thoughts are so perfectly formed that they just flow straight into words. But I've never known anyone who could do this, and if I met someone who said they could, it would seem evidence of their limits rather than their ability. Indeed, this is a trope in movies: the guy who claims to have a plan for doing some difficult thing, and who when questioned more, taps his head and says "It's all up here." Everyone watching the movie knows what that means. At best the plan is vague and not complete. Very likely there's some unknown flaw that invalidates it completely. At best it's a plan for a plan.

In precisely defined domains it's possible to form complete ideas in your head. People can play chess in their heads, for example. And mathematicians can do some amount of math in their heads, though they don't seem to feel sure of a proof over a certain length until they write it down. But this only seems possible with ideas you can say in a formal language. [1] Maybe what such people are doing is putting ideas into words in their heads. I can to some extent write essays in my head. I'll sometimes think of a paragraph while walking or lying in bed that stays nearly the same in the final version. But really I'm writing when I do this. I'm doing the mental part of writing; my fingers just aren't moving as I do it. [2]

You can know a great deal about something without writing about it. Can you ever know so much that you wouldn't learn more from trying to explain what you know? I don't think so. I've written about at least two subjects I know well — Lisp hacking and startups — and in both cases I learned a lot from writing about them. In both cases there were things I didn't consciously realize until I had to explain them. And I don't think my experience was unusual. A great deal of knowledge is unconscious, and experts have if anything a higher proportion of unconscious knowledge than beginners.

I'm not saying that writing is the best way to explore all ideas. If you have ideas about architecture, presumably the best way to explore them is to build actual buildings. What I'm saying is that however much you learn from exploring ideas in other ways, you'll still learn new things from writing about them.

Putting ideas into words doesn't have to mean writing, of course. You can also do it the old way, by talking. But in my experience, writing is the stricter test. You have to agree to a single, best sequence of words. Less can go unsaid when you don't have tone of voice to carry meaning. And you can focus in a way that would seem like a lot in conversation. I'll often spend 2 weeks on an essay and reread drafts 50 times. If you did that in conversation it would seem like evidence of some kind of mental problem. If you're lazy, of course, writing and talking are equally useless. But if you want to push yourself to get things right, writing is the steeper hill.
